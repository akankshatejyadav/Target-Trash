Waste Management System .
## AIM - 
According to survey huge amount (millions of tones) of recycleable waste do not get recycled and hence pollution level rises every second . So in order to protect the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> the website is developed . <br>
<br>
This Website aims at bridging the gap between <b>PEOPLE</b> and <b>WASTE-DEALERS</b> .<br>
The problem of <b><i>waste management</i></b> can be easily be fixed with the use of this website .

Different users can signup and login to give information about the household waste they have collected .<br>
These information maybe given by different inputs like type of waste , quantity of waste , waste product names etc .<br>
These info are mandatory for the user to provide in order to get the pick up waste done .
The most important info for the user will be time of pickup . The user will provide time for pickup as per his/her convinence .

Then these inputs will be displayed to the specific waste dealer as according to the piuncode of area . 
They will check the feasibility that if waste pick up can be done or not .
If it can be made then noyification will be send to the user , of request granted .

<b>The most important thing is that users will get credit for the waste pickup . </b>
These credits will make people to collect the waste rather than throwing them away . it will be effective because if any person will get the credit for the waste they will not let it get away . This will help in <b>reuse</b> of the product and hence eventually decrease the pollution level of the environment .
